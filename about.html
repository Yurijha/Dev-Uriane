            <h2><strong>A Peek Into Who I Am</strong></h2>

            <p class="box">Hello there, my name is <strong>Uriane</strong> and I'm all  about fostering creativity, whether it's through music or the digital realm. My journey began with a deep love for musicâ€”I've dabbled in playing instruments like drums and saxophone, sung in choirs, performed spoken word, produced instrumentals, and crafted both Hip-Hop and R&B tracks. I'm sharing this because just as these pursuits are seen as forms of artistic expression, I firmly believe that coding is an art in its own right. Bringing bright ideas to life with keystrokes that requires developing a skillset that not everyone is inclined to be interested in is beautiful and drives me.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="box">In the expansive world of development and digital marketing, often referred to as Martech, creativity intertwines with analytical thinking and security measures. Personally, I'm drawn to Web Development and Digital Marketing. What truly excites me about being a developer/digital marketer is the perpetual need to learn and adapt to new technologies. This ever-evolving landscape means developers and marketers alike have the freedom to explore various roles within the creation process. Like many others in this field, I possess the ability to leverage my existing skills while acquiring new ones, even if they diverge from my honed technological focus.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="box">With determination and hard work, nothing is beyond reach. I've found that my interests evolve over time, often driven by a desire for tangible rewards. Development and digital marketing offer consistent and incentive-driven career paths, where working directly with clients allows me to bring their visions to life while also providing ample opportunities for personal creativity and exploration.</p>
