            <h2><strong>A Peek Into Who I Am</strong></h2>

            <p class="box">Hello, my name is <strong>Uriane</strong>. I love creation and it all began with my love for
                music. I've played several instruments over the years like the drums and saxophone for example. I have
                sang in the choir, performed spoken word, produced instrumentals, and written Hip-Hop songs as well as
                R&B. I'm sharing all of this because these talents and skills are viewed as artistic expression, and I
                believe that coding is an art. Bringing bright ideas to life with keystrokes that requires developing a
                skillset that not everyone is inclined to be interested in is beautiful and drives me.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="box">The development world is full of options for creative, analytical, and securing
                occupations. I personally enjoy and employ skills for Front End Development. The greatest part of
                being a programmer or coder is the constant need and ability to learn
                new technologies. That means there is essentially no limit to the type of work or role a developer
                can play in a creation process. So while my skills may lean in one direction, I as well as others in
                this field have the aptitude to apply
                what we've learned thus far to another role while gaining new information even if it doesn't
                directly stem from the technologies we're accustomed to.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="box">There is no sight too out of reach with determination and hard work. I found that my
                interests changed over time in hopes to have immediate or visible reward for the amount of work put
                in at any given time. Development has proven to be a largely consistent incentive driven career path.
                Working directly with clients
                allows the chance to fulfill each specific detail of their vision and also provides large
                opportunity for exploration of my own creativity.</p>
