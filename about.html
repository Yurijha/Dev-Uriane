            <h2><strong>A Peek Into Who I Am</strong></h2>

            <p class="box">Hello, my name is <strong>Uriane</strong> —a creative technologist who bridges the gap between software development and digital marketing. My artistic foundation seamlessly transitioned into the world of coding, where I discovered that building digital experiences is another form of creative expression.​</p>

            <br>

            <p class="box">With a strong background in front-end development, I craft user-centric websites and applications that are both functional and visually compelling. With a robust foundation in front-end development, I specialize in creating responsive, user-focused digital experiences. My expertise spans a range of modern programming languages and frameworks, including:</p>
            
            <p class="box">
            
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML5 & CSS3: Crafting clean, semantic, and standards-compliant code to build visually compelling and accessible interfaces.</li>

                    <li>React: Building modular, reusable components for scalable web applications with enhanced performance and seamless user experiences.</li>

                    <li>Tailwind CSS & Bootstrap: Leveraging utility-first CSS frameworks to streamline development and ensure design consistency across projects.</li>

                    <li>Version Control with Git: Collaborating efficiently on team projects with a strong command of Git workflows, GitHub, and GitLab.</li>

                    <li>API Integration: Connecting applications to external data sources and services using RESTful APIs, enabling enhanced functionality and interoperability.</li>
            
                </ul>
            </p>
    

In addition to these core technical skills, I have experience working with content management systems like WordPress and Shopify, where I customize themes, optimize performance, and implement e-commerce solutions. This hands-on expertise ensures I can deliver tailored solutions for a variety of business needs, from small startups to established enterprises.

My coding philosophy combines precision, creativity, and problem-solving, allowing me to adapt to emerging technologies and industry trends. Whether building an intuitive user interface or debugging complex systems, I approach every challenge with meticulous attention to detail and a passion for continuous learning.</p>

            <br>

           <p class="box">
    Simultaneously, my expertise in digital marketing empowers me to enhance online visibility, engagement, and conversions. I specialize in creating strategic campaigns that combine paid and organic methods to deliver measurable results. My experience includes:
    <br><br>
    <strong>• SEO:</strong> Optimizing websites to improve search engine rankings and drive organic traffic.<br>
    <strong>• Paid Search & Advertising:</strong> Managing campaigns across platforms like Google Ads and social media channels, focusing on maximizing ROI and engagement.<br>
    <strong>• Social Media Strategy:</strong> Developing targeted content and campaigns to increase brand awareness and connect with audiences effectively.<br>
    <strong>• Email Marketing:</strong> Crafting impactful email campaigns that nurture leads and drive conversions.<br>
    <strong>• Analytics & Reporting:</strong> Utilizing tools like Google Analytics to track performance metrics, generate actionable insights, and refine strategies for continuous improvement.
</p>
<p class="box">
    By merging technical skills with marketing strategies, I offer a holistic approach to digital solutions that drive growth and innovation. Whether it's optimizing a website for search engines or crafting a multi-channel marketing campaign, my goal is to deliver results that align with your vision and objectives.
